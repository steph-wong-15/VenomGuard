# VenomGuard

## Inspiration
The idea of identifying snakes while hiking. Users could take a photo of the snake and the app could provide information about the snake so in case of a snakebite, the correct antidote can quickly be found by emergency personnel.

## What it does
A web app where a user can upload snake images and the snake in the image will be identified.

## How we built it
We build the frontend using React and the backend using Flask. The model was implemented in Python using machine learning libraries.

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up Python libraries and cleaning data. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the base of the web app done and the start of the snake identification model training.

## What we learned
We about how to create the frontend and backend of a web app and how to work with Python machine learning libraries.

## What's next for VenomGuard
Adding a chat feature that advises the user how to take care of the wound based on the identification. Sending a summary to a health care provider.
